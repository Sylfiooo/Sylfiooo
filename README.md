# Hi there 👋, Welcome !

## About me 👨‍🎓

Hey ! My name is Alexis, but you can call me **Sylfio**.

I am a french developer from Lyon. (French touch, yeah !) 

Having completed my IT engineering studies at **CPE Lyon**, I'm now a “Software Design and Development Engineer” at Thales. I am curious about **thesis topics** in the field of **AI** and **behavioral simulation in a controlled environment**, **education**, and **medical/biological field**. If you have any insights or know of interesting projects, **feel free to share!** 🙋‍♂️
 
A few things to know about me :
* 🎲 I'm a fan of **tabletop role-playing games** (and **board games** too)
* ✍️ I love **discovering new stories** through recent media *(cinemas, video games, music, etc...)*
* ⚙️ I prefer back-end to front-end, but as long as I can practice algorithms, I'm ready !
* ☕ Sorry Microsoft worshipers, but here we prefer **Java** to C#
* 🆕 Always ready to **test new things** and improve in different areas of IT !

## Interesting projects I worked on

### Nuit de l'info 2019 : [Increasing the power to act of students in precarious situations](https://www.nuitdelinfo.com/materiel_communication/2019/La_Nuit_de_l_Info_2019-Sujet.pdf)(🇫🇷) 🥇

La **Nuit de l'Info** is a French **team web development competition** taking place every year, in which **thousands of students** participate, from **baccalaureate to engineers**. An overall topic is defined by the organization **when the sun goes down**, and a web application must be delivered by **sunrise**.
Having participated in the first year of higher studies with a team of 11 people (named **Dream Team**) from the same year of my course, I was able to set up a web server for the first time and develop a site which allowed us to win **first place** in the competition ! The ordeal was very educational for people new to the IT world like us.
