# Hi there 👋, Welcome !

## About me 👨‍🎓

Hey ! My name is Alexis, but you can call me **Sylfio**.

I am a french developer from Lyon. (French touch, yeah !) 

Currently at the end of my computer engineering course at **CPE Lyon**, I am looking for a **thesis subject** for the coming years, in the field of **AI** and **behavioral simulation in a controlled environment**. Don't hesitate if you have any leads, **I'm interested !** 🙋‍♂️

A few things to know about me :
* 🎲 I'm a fan of **tabletop role-playing games** (and **board games** too)
* ✍️ I love **discovering new stories** through recent media *(cinemas, video games, music, etc...)*
* ⚙️ I prefer back-end to front-end, but as long as I can practice algorithms, I'm ready !
* ☕ Sorry Microsoft worshipers, but here we prefer **Java** to C#
* 🆕 Always ready to **test new things** and improve in different areas of IT !
