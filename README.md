### Hi there 👋, Welcome !

Hey ! 
My name is Alexis THOMAS, but you can call me **Sylfio**.

I am a french developer from Lyon. 

Currently at the end of my computer engineering course at CPE Lyon, I am looking for a thesis subject for the coming years, in the field of AI and behavioral simulation in a controlled environment. Don't hesitate if you have any leads, I'm interested!

As for the rest:
* I'm a fan of tabletop role-playing games
* I love discovering new stories through recent media (cinemas, video games, music, etc...)
* I prefer back-end to front-end, but as long as I can practice algorithms, I'm ready !
* Sorry Microsoft worshipers, but here we prefer Java to C#
* Always ready to test new things and improve in different areas of IT !
